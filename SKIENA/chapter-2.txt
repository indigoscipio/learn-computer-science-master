RAM Modeling

Addiiton, mult, comparison = 1 step
Memory read/write= 1step


Big O
measures number of steps grows
as the input size n grows
it measure growth rate, not runtime
what is the shape of the curve?

O(n²) = “you’ll never go faster than n² steps”

Ω(n) = “you’ll always go at least n steps”

Θ(n log n) = “you consistently hover around n log n steps”


===========

f(n) = Your actual travel time in a specific car

g(n) = Travel time of a rocket bike

If you say "My car is O(rocket bike)", you're saying: 
On a long enough road, my car will never be slower than a rocket bike.
The rocket bike is a valid upper bound for my car's speed."

O = "Won't be worse than..." (Upper bound)

Ω = "Won't be better than..." (Lower bound)

Θ = "Grows exactly like..." (Tight bound - most informative!)

Problem: 
is (x + y)^2 = O(x^2 + y^2)?

answer:
by the definitino of O(n), f(n) = O(g(n)) iff there exists constant c
such that  n f (n) <= c g(n)
(x+y)^2 <= (x^2 + y^2) for some constant c

LHS
(x + y) (x + y) 
= x^2 + 2xy + y^2 <= c(x^2 + y^2) for all sufficiently large x,y

we need to show 2xy is less than or equal to some constant times (x^2 + y^2)

since we know any real number squared is always >= 0
(x-y)^2 >= 0
(x^2 + 2xy + y^2) >= 0
x^2 + y^2 >= 2xy

x² + 2xy + y² ≤ x² + (x² + y²) + y²



 ===================

 Stop and think: transitive experience
 problem: show that big o relationship are transitive.
that is, if f (n) = O (g(n)) and
g(n) = O(h(n)), then f(n) = O(h(n))

answer:

f(n) = O(g(n))
by definition, f(n) = o(g(n)) iff there exists constant c such that 
n . f(n) <= c g(n)
this means f grows much slower than g

g(n) = O(h(n))
n . g(n) <= c h(n)
this means g grows slower than h

therefore if f < g, then g < h
so f < g < h
