Data types

integers -> exact
fractions -> floating point approximation

what is floating point?
a way for computer to approximate decimal
similar to scientific notation

==========

infix -> standard notation,
opration sits between arguments, eg (3 + 5)

prefix
operation sits before argument, like racket (+ 3 5)

=============

precedence / order of operation
PEMDAS

association
3 - 7 - 2 - how to evaluate it?
left to right
(3 - 7) - 2

===============

 in fp, function application is treated with the highest priority

 Precedence - stickiness hierarchy
 - function application
 - exponentiation
 - mult/div
 - add/sub

 Order of association
 left-associative
group left to right
most of arithmetic does this

 right-associative
 group right to left
 exponentiation does this


 ======

 operators and sections
 (+) - this is a section
 enclosing operator converts to a prefix function

 (+) x y -> x + y

 both f x = f x x
 both (*) 5 = (*) 5 5 = 25
