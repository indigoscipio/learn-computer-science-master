Data types

integers -> exact
fractions -> floating point approximation

what is floating point?
a way for computer to approximate decimal
similar to scientific notation

==========

infix -> standard notation,
opration sits between arguments, eg (3 + 5)

prefix
operation sits before argument, like racket (+ 3 5)

=============

precedence / order of operation
PEMDAS

association
3 - 7 - 2 - how to evaluate it?
left to right
(3 - 7) - 2

===============

 in fp, function application is treated with the highest priority

 Precedence - stickiness hierarchy
 - function application
 - exponentiation
 - mult/div
 - add/sub

 Order of association
 left-associative
group left to right
most of arithmetic does this

 right-associative
 group right to left
 exponentiation does this


 ======

 operators and sections
 (+) - this is a section
 enclosing operator converts to a prefix function

 (+) x y -> x + y

 both f x = f x x
 both (*) 5 = (*) 5 5 = 25

 computing sqrt of a number using approximation
 sqrt is defined as

 sqrt x >= 0 and sqrt(x)^2 = x

 here we define it as
 sqrt x >= 0 and abs(sqrt(x)^2 - x) < eps

 newton's method
 yn+1 = (yn + x / yn) / 2
 y = approximation
 yn = current guess
 yn + 1 = next guess
 x = target number - value stays the same - number that you want the square root of

 why -x ? to see hwo far the error/distance between landing spot vs target

 example:
 x = 9 - we wanna find the sqrt of 9
 suppose y0 (initial guess) = 1
 find the next guess
 yn+1 = 1 + 9 /1 / 2
 y1 = 10 / 2 = 5 -> is 5^2 close to 9? no, 25-9 = 16. still too far
 
 keep guessing, find y2
y2 = 5 + 9/5 / 2 = 3.4

keep guessing
y3 = 3.4 + 9 / 3.4 / 2 = 3.4 + 2.6 / 2 = ~3...


improve x y = (y + x/y) / 2 - the averaging machine
satis x y = abs(y^2 - x) < eps - the stopping condigion

until p f x = x - the loop
            = until p f (f x) otherwise
where p = the stopping condiiton checker
f = the averaging machine
x = the target number of sqrt we wanna find

until: (a -> bool) -> (a -> a) -> a -> a

Exercises

2.1.1
the oeprators x and div have the same binding power and associate to the left
what is the value of the following expr?

1. 3 div 1 x 3
2. 3 x 7 div 4
3. 6 div 2 x 8 div 4

answer:
1. 3 x 3 = 9
2. 21 div 4 = 5
3. 6 div 2 = 3
3 x 8 div 4
24 div 4 = 6

2.1.2
using the definition of mod given in 2.1.3
show that for all positive x,y, and z

definition from 2.1.3
x = q * y + r and 0 <= r < y
where q = quotient
r = reminder
y = divisor

1. (x + y) mod z = (x mod z + y mod z) mod z
2. x x (y mod z) = (x + y) mod (x x z)

answer:
LHS
(x + y) mod z

x = q1 * z + r1
y = q2 * z + r2

= (q1 * z + r1) + (q2 * z + r2)
= q1 * z + q2 * z + r1 + r2
= z (q1 + q2) + r1 + r2
since q1 and q2 is a multiple of z, it has no reminder
= r1 + r2
= ...
