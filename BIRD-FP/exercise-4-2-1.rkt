Exercises 
of bigits zs, 
4.2.1 Define a function absint so that if number z is represented by the list 
then: 
z = absint zs 
Check that 
absint ([0] * zs) = absint zs 
Hence justify the equation: 
absint (strep zs) = absint zs 
where strep returns the standard representation of a number.

;
answer:
lets just st normal base 10 instead of bigits to simplify

so if we have xs = [1,2,3]

x = absint [1,2,3]??
