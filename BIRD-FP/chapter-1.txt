Referrential Transparency
An expression can be replaced by its value without changing the program’s meaning.


how fp works
- sees an expression
- substitute that expression using definition (the RULE)
- simplify that expression using the defintion
- keep evaluating until you see no value that can be evaluated
- that value ist he final value

building definitionw
what is a definition?
A definition is how the program “knows” what a name means.
it is a set of rule that govern how the program behaves
definition are always algebraic in nature

eg. square x = x . x
min x y = if x < y return x else return y

canonical expression = expression that cannot be simplified further
aka normal form

referrential transparency
equal expression can be repalced with each other anywhere
(+ 3 4) -> can be replaced with 7

value does not equal representaiton of a value
49 = 7 x 7 = XLIX = 110001
FP is about value, not representation of a value

order of value does not matter
because epression always evaluate to the same value
no matter how you reduce them
