Data Structures

Contiguous vs Linked

Contiguous
Array -> each elmelent can be located by its index/house number
A street full of houses

+ instant time access/lookups
+ space efficent
+ memory locality
+ great for iteratiog

- cant do n+1 /more than n/fixed memory size
- resizing sucks

Linked
List, trees
houses that points to other houses,
to get address #500, you'd need to find house #1, hosue #2, etc

+ easy insertion/deletion
+ flexible memory allocation
- slow lookup
- not cache friendly

=================================

Pointers
connection that hold the piece of linked structures together, like a chain
represnts the address of a location



=================================

Stacks and queues

you put things in, you take things out later
the difference between stacks and queues is the rule that you decide
what to take out next.

Stack (LIFO)
cafetaria trays - only cares about the most recent item
- Undo functionality
- function call stack
- browser back button

Queue (FIFO)
movie ticket queue/orderly coffee shop
fair ordering
- ticket purchasing app
- print document
- BFS 


========================================

Dictionaries

is a storage system dhat does 3 things:
- insert
- delete
- search

key-value structure
keys are unique
hash table is a dicitionary

stop and think: comparing dictionary implementations

 Problem: What are the asymptotic worst-case running times for each of the seven
 fundamental dictionary operations (search, insert, delete, successor, predecessor,
 minimum, and maximum) when the data structure is implemented as:

 • An unsorted array.
 • Asorted array.

answer:
unsorted  array
search: you have to check the item 1 by 1 if you wanna earch for something , so worst case is O(n)
insert: since this is unserted O(1)
delete: finding the element is O(n) then shift 
successor: need to find the entire array, O(n)
predeccor: same as successor, O(n)
min: need to check all elements, O(n)
max: same as min, O(n)

 
sorted
search: we can use binary search, so O(log nn)
insert: the item inserted needs to be sorted so need to check each element 1 by 1 O(n)
delete: same as insert, check element 1 by 1 then shift O(n)
successor: o1
predeccor: o1
min: O(1) since its sorted, just get the head
max: O(1) same as min

read/write
read -> sorted
write -> unsorted


comparing dictionary implementations
singly linked unsorted list
search: 
insert: 
delete: 
successor: 
predeccor: 
min: 
max: 

singly linked unsorted list
search: 
insert: 
delete: 
successor: 
predeccor: 
min: 
max:
