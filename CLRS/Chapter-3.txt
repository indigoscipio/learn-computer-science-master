Theta notation
f(n) = the original function
g(n) = the function we're ocmparing with

Theta of g(n) means
the set of all functions that grow the same rate as g(n)

f(n) = theta of g(n) means
f(n) grows proportionlally and they only differ in constatn factors

f(n) = 2n^2 + 500n
g(n) = n^2

f(n) = theta of g(n)

===================================

Big O notation

theta of g(n) is a subset of big O of g(n)

O(g(n))
no matter how hard things get, f(n) will never gorw faster than a constant times g(n)
once n is big enough

worst case

===================================

Omega notation

no slower than g(n)
or the lower bound


====================

2n^2 + 3n + 1 = 2n^2 + theta of  (n)
all those messy constatnt that grows no longer than n^2, just ignore it



Exercises
3.1-1
Let f(n) and g(n) be asymtotically nonnegative functions.
using the basic definition of big theta notation, prove that

max(f(n),g(n)) = big theta of (f(n) + g(n))

answer:
we know that big theta means its sandwitched between the two
so its c1 of g(n) <= f(n) <= c2 of g(n) or something like that so it has upper end and lowerend
and the two functions grow at the same rate up to constants

so we need to find c1(f(n)+g(n)) <= max(f(n),g(n)) <= c2(f(n)+g(n))

and max function search for the maximum value
and we know sum  is at least always as big as the bigger one
and the max sum ratio is no larger than factor of 2

so max(f(n),g(n)) <= f(n) + g(n) <= 2.max(f(n),g(n))

show that for any real constants of a and b, where b>0
(n+a)^b = big theta of (n^b)
