RAM model
is basically a simplified yet perfect, idealized pc
because algorithm speed is hard to measure we need a standard unit, thus the ram model is used

Time depends on input size & shape

Measuring input size
array = n
numbers = number of bits to represetn them
graphs= vertices, edges
pick a measure that makes sense


running time = how long your algorithm takes from start to finish
sum of (cost of operation x number of time it executes) 
sometimes it depends on the size of the input
and how already "sorted" the input is
