/*
CHAPTER 13: Strings

STRING LITERAL
"this is a string"
like racket but iwth \0 to seperate
we can't modifiy it - read only!

DONT change a string literal
char *p = "abc"
*p = 'd'

SINGLE CHAR STRING LITERAL
"a" vs 'a'

INITIALIZATION
just use a[unspeficied] = "STRING" for safety

CHAR VS ARR POINTER
*date = "June 13" -> cannot be modiifed - string literal!
date[] = "June 13" -> can be modified - make a copy

ILEGAL
str1 = "abc"
str2 = str1


'\0' is the same as 0 int
'\0' is FALSE
*p = *s2
if *p = '\0' this is treated as false
