/*
Assignment is not a command
It's an action that returns a value

= is right associative
i = j = k = 0
start at right and work backwards in C
k = 0
j = k (0)
i = j (k=0)

assignment has very low precedence (at the bottom)

L value - a mailbox
oject stored in computer memory
i

POST-FIX operator
has the most precedence
i++ - take a snapeshot, increment aftwareds
++i - increment first, take a snapshot aftewards

PRECEDENCE LEVEL
1. ++ --
2. + -
3. * / %
4. + -
5. = *= etc
