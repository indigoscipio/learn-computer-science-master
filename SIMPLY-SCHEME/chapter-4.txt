Special form

(define x y)
why is it special form?
if it was a regular prodcedure

(define (square x) (* x x))

then it would evaulate (sqare x) first which doesn't eist
when you see define, stop what you usuallyl do

it has its own evaluation rule

expression represents procedure invocation
Scheme first evaluates all the subexpressions,
then applies resulting procedure to the argument value

argument vs parameter

square x

argument = the value that is passed on to square x (eg square 7)
parameter = the template x

exercises
4.1
consider this procedure
(define (ho-hum x y)
    (+ x (* 2 y))
)

show substitution that occurs when you evaluate
(ho-hum 8 12)
when its evlauated, the procedure ho hum runs and it binds x = 8 and y = 12
so (+ 8 (* 2 12))

4.2
(define (yawn x)
    (+ 3 (* x 2))
)
list all ittle people when evaluating
(yawn (/ 8 2))

there are 3little people
1. the division specialist (evaluates argument inside (yawn))
2. the function yawn/master specialist which cals the body
3. + specialist -> (+ 3 (* x 2))
4. * specialist -> (* x 2)

4.3
here are some procedure defintions

4.4
each of the following procedure definitinos has an erorr of some kind
say what's wrong and why and fix it
(define (sphere–volume r)
(* (/ 4 3) 3.141592654)
(* r r r))
answer: this does not have 1 return value (* ...) (* 3...)
fixed versoin:
(define (sphere–volume r)
(* (/ 4 3) 3.141592654 (* r r r)))

(define (next x)
(x + 1)
)
answer: this one has the wrong operator placement
fixed: (+ x 1)


(define (square) (* x x))
answer: this one the procedure square does not take any argument
the body doesn't know what x is

fixed: (define (square x) (* x x))

(define (triangle–area triangle)
(* 0.5 base height))
answer: this one only takes one argument (triangle) and does not take height

fixed: just add base to the argument (triangle-area base triangle ..)

(define (sum–of–squares (square x) (square y))
  (+ (square x) (square y)))
  answer: this one the procedure takes a function applicaion as its argument
  to fix just do (sum-of-squares x y)

  4.6 Define a procedure fourth that computes the fourth power of its argument. Do this two ways, first using the 
multiplication function, and then using square and not (directly) using multiplication.

first day:
(define (fourth n)
    (* n (* n (* n n)))
)

second:
(define (forth n)
    (sqr (sqr n))
)
