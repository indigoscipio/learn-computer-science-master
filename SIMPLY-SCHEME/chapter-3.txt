in scheme, parentheses are never optinal

If the order of the "same level" people doesn't matter, let's look at this expression:
(+ (* 10 10) (* 2 2))
doest matter if 10 * 10 is first the result is always the same

exercise 3
3.1 
translate arith expression (3+4) * 5 and 3 + (4*5) into scheme expression
and into plumbing diagrams


(+ 3 4) * 5
pipe 1 -> evaluate 3 + 4  = 7
then goes into pipe * -> 7 *  5 = 35

3.2
how many little peopl does alonzo hire in evaluating each of these following expressions

1. (+ 3 (* 4 5) (- 10 4)) (* 3 x x)
2. the * operation (* 4 5)
3. the - operation (- 10 4)

3.4 Five little people are hired in evaluating the following expression:
(+ (* 3 (- 4 7))
   (- 8 (- 3 5)))

3.9 The expression (+ 8 2) has the value 10. It is a compound expression made up of three atoms. For this problem, 
write five other Scheme expressions whose values are also the number ten:
• An atom
• Another compound expression made up of three atoms
• A compound expression made up of four atoms
• A compound expression made up of an atom and two compound subexpressions
• Any other kind of expression

answer:
1. 10
2. (+ 2 8)
3. (+ 2 4 4)
4. (+ (+ 2 2) (+ 3 3))
5. (- 12 2)
