Chapter 7

Variables

two ways of thining about variables:
- imperative - mutable
- functonal - just tag it once and don't modify

shadowing:
where global variable gets shadow /replaced
by a local variable


; let is just a syntactic sugar
for calling an anonymous procedure

(let ((x 5)) (+ x 10))
is equal to
((lambda (x) (+ x 10)) 5)


let evaluates all values/variables first before binding 

let -> all variables are created simultaneously
let* -> variables are created sequentially, like a nested let

let is a special form that takes 2 args
arg 1 - list of name value pairs in parenthesis
arg 2 - body of let - expr to evaluate
