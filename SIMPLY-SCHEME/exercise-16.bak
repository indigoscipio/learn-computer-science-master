THE RULE
* Royal flush: ten, jack, queen, king, and ace, all of the same suit
• Straight flush: five cards of sequential rank, all of the same suit
• Four of a kind: four cards of the same rank
• Full house: three cards of the same rank, and two of a second rank
• Flush: five cards of the same suit, not sequential rank
• Straight: five cards of sequential rank, not all of the same suit
• Three of a kind: three cards of the same rank, no other matches
• Two pair: two pairs of cards, of two different ranks
• Pair: two cards of the same rank, no other matches
• Nothing: none of the above
