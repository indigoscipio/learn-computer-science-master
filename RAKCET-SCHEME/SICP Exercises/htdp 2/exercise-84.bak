(define-struct editor [pre post])
; An Editor is a structure:
;   (make-editor String String)
; interpretation (make-editor s t) describes an editor
; whose visible text is (string-append s t) with 
; the cursor displayed between s and t
(define sample-editor (make-editor "LOL" "SSS")) 


; edit is a function that consumes two inputs:
; Editor KeyEvent -> Editor
; the task is to add a single char keyevent to the end of pre field of editor
; unless keyevent detects backspace (\b)
; if this happens, it deletes the character immediately to the left of the cursor (if ther are any)
; the function ignores the tab and return key
; the function pays attention to only two keyevent longer than one letter: "left" and "right"



; Render is a function that consumes Editor and produces an image
; render the text within empty scene of 200x20
; with a 1x20 rd rectangle
; Editor -> Image
