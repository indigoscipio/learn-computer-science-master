; A Track is a structure:
;   (make-track String String String N N Date N Date)
; interpretation An instance records in order: the track's 
; title, its producing artist, to which album it belongs, 
; its playing time in milliseconds, its position within the 
; album, the date it was added, how often it has been 
; played, and the date when it was last played
 
;(define-struct date [year month day hour minute second])
; A Date is a structure:
;   (make-date N N N N N N)
; interpretation An instance records six pieces of information:
; the date's year, month (between 1 and 12 inclusive), 
; day (between 1 and 31), hour (between 0 
; and 23), minute (between 0 and 59), and 
; second (also between 0 and 59).
