#|exercise 225: design a firefighting game;

The game is set in the western states where fires rage through vast forests.
It simulates an airborne fire-fighting effort. Specifically, the player acts as the pilot of an airplane
that drops loads of water on fires on the ground. The player controls the plane’s horizontal
movements and the release of water loads.

Your game software starts fires at random places on the ground.
You may wish to limit the number of fires, making them a function of how many fires are currently burning or other factors.
The purpose of the game is to extinguish all fires in a limited amount of time.
Hint Use an iterative design approach as illustrated in this chapter to create this game. |#
