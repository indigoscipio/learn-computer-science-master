;List-of-string is the following:
; '()
; String List-of-string

; String -> String
; produces the content of file f as a string 
(define (read-file f) ...)
(read-lines main-file)
 
; String -> List-of-string
; produces the content of file f as a list of strings, 
; one per line
(define (read-lines f) ...)
 
; String -> List-of-string
; produces the content of file f as a list of strings, 
; one per word
(define (read-words f) ...)
 
; String -> List-of-list-of-string
; produces the content of file f as a list of list of
; strings, one list per line and one string per word 
(define (read-words/line f) ...)
 
; The above functions consume the name of a file as a String
; argument. If the specified file does not exist in the
