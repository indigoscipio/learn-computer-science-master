What is a trivially solvable problem?
How are trivial problems solved?
How does the algorithm generate new, smaller problems?
How do we combine the solutions of the smaller problems into the final solution?

Bundle problem
bundles elements in a list of n chunks.
Takes a number n and a list of items


1. What is a trivially solvable problem?
If the list is empty or only contains one element
If it's a single element

2. How are trivial problems solved?
If the list is empty, return '() because there's nothing left to process
If its a single element the nreturn '(())

3. how does the algorithm generate new problem?
Take the first n element of the list and group it into sublist
Recursively bundle the rest of the list with the removed first n element

4. how do we combine solution
First bundled sublist is appended recursively with the rest of the list.



Quick sort problem
Takes a list of number and return a sorted list of number

1. What is trivially solvable problem?
If the list is only 1
If the list is empty

2. How are trivial problems solved?
If the list is only 1, return as it is (theres notrhing to sort)
If the list is empty, return an empty list

3. How does it generate new problem?
Pick pivot and divide the list into smaller and larger
